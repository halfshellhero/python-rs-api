I'm not a developer, but am trying to build some python skills.  Please don't take any of this code seriously as it's probably junk.

Challenge 1: Write a script that builds three 512 MB Cloud Servers that following a similar naming convention. (ie., web1, web2, web3) and returns the IP and login credentials for each server. Use any image you want. 
 - challenge1.py

Challenge 2: Write a script that clones a server (takes an image and deploys the image as a new server). 
 - challenge2.py

Challenge 3: Write a script that accepts a directory as an argument as well as a container name. The script should upload the contents of the specified directory to the container (or create it if it doesn't exist). The script should handle errors appropriately. (Check for invalid paths, etc.)
 - challenge3.py

Challenge 4: Write a script that uses Cloud DNS to create a new A record when passed a FQDN and IP address as arguments.
 - challenge4.py

Challenge 5: Write a script that creates a Cloud Database instance. This instance should contain at least one database, and the database should have at least one user that can connect to it.
 - challenge5.py

Challenge 6: Write a script that creates a CDN-enabled container in Cloud Files.
 - challenge6.py

Challenge 7: Write a script that will create 2 Cloud Servers and add them as nodes to a new Cloud Load Balancer.
 - challenge7.py
